# Letter Generator

# About

Life is too short for cover letters and we generally use templates for that :). However even replacing values are a headache and I wanted to make that easier. I named this little project as Letter Generator because I want to extend with additional capabilities. So, don't hesitate to request it from me :)

# How does it work?

You can simply write a template article or letter and state the places you want to be replaced with squared brackets such as [Company Name]. Don't forget to add these to the args node with their corresponding value.

# What's next?

I'm planning to make the ui part of it if I'll have the time for that and after, you will be able to use it easier
